UoY RTS Thing.

Design of project needs further specification, but breakdown of code orginization should be as follows:

RTS/Assests The main section we will work in, as this is the normal set up with unity

RTS/Assets/Engine For sections of code directly aimed at the engine of the RTS: resources, players, cameras

RTS/Assets/Networking For sections of code directly aimed at networking, e.g. multiplayer

RTS/Assets/Content For sections of code directly aimed at content, e.g. units, buildings, maps
